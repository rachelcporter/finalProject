<h2> About This Page </h2>
<p> Welcome to this interactive web app guide I created for those travelling to New York City. In the summer of 2018, I lived in the Financial District in New York City for three months while interning for PR Consulting, a fashion consulting firm. While I was there, I learned the in's and out's of the city and discovered helpful tips and tricks to navigating the city, along with things to do. Please scroll though the page to learn more.</p>

<div id="subwayText" class="text">
	<p> The best way to navigate the subway system in New York to avoid getting lost and stay on time is with the Google Maps iPhone app. This app has real-time updates and will show you the most efficient travel method. Goodle Maps can be used on a web browser or downloaded as an app. There is also an option that allows you to save directions for when you go underground and may lose cell service.

	<p> The Empire State Building offers tours to the top that allows visitors to see the entire city of New York from 102 floors up. The tours happen year-round and offer several different experiences. A ticket for an adult starts at $58. For more information and links to buy your ticket, <a href="http://www.esbnyc.com/">click here.</a></p>

	<p> In the age of social media, if you're looking to improve your Instagram feed or take fun pictures with friends, New York is the place to go. In addition to the cityscapes and streets, there are also pop-up museums that are opened as exhibitions for the purpose of interactivity and taking pictures. When I was there over the summer there was the Color Factory, the Pint Shop, the Dream Machine and more. A lot are seasonal and will require you to purchase a ticket, but are a fun way to spend a few hours during your day. For a list of all the current pop-up exhibits, be sure to check out this <a href="https://www.cityguideny.com/article/instagrammable-moments-new-york-instagram-popups#.XA7x7xNKjow">website.</a></p>

<div id="bridgeText" class="text">
	<p> Take a walking tour of the Brooklyn Bridge at sunrise to catch a view of the city. The bridge is about 1.1 miles long and will take about an hour, but is definitely worth the time.
